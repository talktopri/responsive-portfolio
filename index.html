        <p>I have been everywhere and back: in my previous life, I was a journalist in Brazil, I worked for private organizations and took care of their communications affairs. Then, in the USA, I chose to wear many different hats to see which one would fit better: I have been a babysitter, a door-to-door saleswoman, a sales associate, and, more recently, a Support Engineer.</p>

        <p>I am now making this new hat for myself. I guess it is more of an enhancement to the hat I currently wear: I want to continue being a Support Engineer, but I want to understand what the users I support do, and the problems they encounter, so that I can be better at helping them.</p>

        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! This is an ever-changing page, where you will be able to see pretty much all the steps I've taken to reach higher grounds. Have fun!</p>

        <p>See you around, Pri.</p>
